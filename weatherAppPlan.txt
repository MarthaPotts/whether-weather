Whether-Weather Plan/JS:

Search:
//event 
Click, function(fetch); 
//
Fetch data: 
getAPI function()
Get by ?city
To LocalStorage, JSON/string/parse and set/get: makes an object/array
Loops for data
Sort Data
Name/Date/Icon: 
Function to recognize icons by keyword
Temp/humidity/wind/uv-index
Function to change color based on uv index value ranges
5 day forecast data 
Functions to populate those cards...
Function to save previously viewed city weather data by cityName and a retrieve by click function (event)

call API, fetch/GET data (discern if it's one call or 2 calls for current and 5-day-forecast)
if its 2 calls, set up function for 2 calls. 
response from API, save to localStorage with setItem. Loop through data to create a sort/render function that will render the current and forecast for current-city-selection; 
need to have a getItem function to retrieve previous-city-searches. Previous city searches should be logged onto the window via SavedCities, by which a click would trigger/call the function to retrieve the data for that city from Local LocalStorage
the data needs saved to be retrieved, so it should all go to localStorage, then be rendered/retrieved.
